Nested Cross-Validation for Feature Selection: A Comparative Study with Nearest Neighbors

This project implements nested cross-validation for feature selection using nearest neighbors with Python 3. The goal is to automatically select the optimal feature based on 5-fold cross-validation and nested 5-fold cross-validation and then evaluate the prediction performance using both ordinary and nested 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, the project compares the C-index produced by nested 5-fold CV with the result of ordinary 5-fold CV using the best value of i (i.e., the feature providing the highest 5-fold CV C-index) and shows the difference between the two methods.
